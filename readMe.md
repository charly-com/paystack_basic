## Paystack Backend

This project provides a backend service for handling Paystack payments. It includes endpoints for initializing and verifying Paystack transactions. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, and it integrates with the Paystack API to process payments securely.

The backend is designed to be hosted on Render or any other platform that supports Node.js.

## Features

Initialize a Payment: Create a Paystack transaction and retrieve an authorization URL.

Verify Payment: Verify the status of a Paystack transaction after payment completion.

## Technologies Used

Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.

Express: Web framework for handling HTTP requests.

Axios: HTTP client for making API calls to Paystack.

dotenv: For loading environment variables securely.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have:

Node.js installed on your local machine.

A Paystack account and your secret key.

A Render account if you're deploying to Render.

Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/paystack-backend.git
cd paystack-backend

2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

npm install

3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your Paystack secret key:

PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_paystack_secret_key

This file will store sensitive data, such as your Paystack secret key, to ensure they are not exposed in version control.

4. Running the Server Locally

To start the server locally, run the following command:

npm start

This will start the Express server on http://localhost:3000 by default. You can now access the API endpoints for initializing and verifying Paystack transactions.

API Endpoints

1. Initialize a Paystack Transaction

Endpoint: POST /paystack/transaction

Description: Initializes a Paystack transaction.

Request Body:

{
"email": "customer@example.com",
"amount": 50000
}

Response:

{
"authorization_url": "https://paystack.co/payment-page",
"reference": "1234567890"
}

2. Verify a Paystack Transaction

Endpoint: POST /paystack/verify

Description: Verifies a Paystack transaction.

Request Body:

{
"reference": "1234567890"
}

Response:

{
"message": "Payment successful",
"data": {
"status": "success",
"reference": "1234567890"
}
}

Deploying to Render

Steps to Deploy:

Create a Render account: If you don't already have one, sign up at Render.

Deploy the backend:

Push your code to a GitHub repository.

Link the repository to Render and deploy your Node.js backend.

Set up your environment variables (e.g., PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY) on Render.

Render will automatically deploy your backend and provide you with a public URL for your API.
